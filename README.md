I do not even know where to begin with the problems I had for this assignment...I understood what it was asking for after a while of just staring at it confused. I just could not figure out how to get the solution(I spent more time on this assignment than I would like to admit). I think it is all the terminology and how things are worded that trip me up. I am hopeful that with time and practice it will become easier.
